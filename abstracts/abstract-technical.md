\# Elyon-Sol — Technical Abstract



\## Problem

Modern AI systems routinely emit confident outputs without regard to domain authority, consent provenance, or escalation requirements. This creates systemic risk in safety-critical and institutional contexts.



\## Approach

Elyon-Sol introduces a governance-first architecture in which:

\- Authority coverage is explicitly modeled

\- Absence of authority is a first-class signal

\- Confidence is decoupled from permission to act

\- Human escalation is mandatory when authority is insufficient



The framework is deterministic, non-recursive, and audit-oriented.



\## Guarantees

\- No automated acceptance in uncovered domains

\- Deterministic escalation paths

\- Explicit consent gates prior to action

\- Full auditability of decision paths



\## What to critique

\- Completeness of authority coverage modeling

\- Correctness of escalation triggers

\- Resistance to overconfidence failure modes



\## Out of scope

\- Performance optimization

\- Model quality or training methodology

\- General AI alignment debates
