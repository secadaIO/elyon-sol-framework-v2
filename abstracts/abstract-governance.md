\# Elyon-Sol — Governance \& Ethics Abstract



\## Problem

Many AI governance frameworks rely on aspirational principles without enforceable mechanisms. Responsibility, consent, and accountability are often ambiguous or non-operational.



\## Approach

Elyon-Sol operationalizes governance by:

\- Requiring explicit consent as a system input

\- Blocking automated action when authority is absent

\- Preserving a clear human accountability chain

\- Enabling post-hoc audit and review



The framework is non-diagnostic and explicitly defers to human and institutional authority.



\## Guarantees

\- Human-in-the-loop escalation by design

\- No silent or implicit consent

\- Clear attribution of responsibility

\- Compatibility with institutional review processes



\## What to critique

\- Sufficiency of consent modeling

\- Alignment with institutional governance norms

\- Audit and traceability completeness



\## Out of scope

\- Legal determinations

\- Replacement of professional judgment

\- Autonomous decision-making claims
