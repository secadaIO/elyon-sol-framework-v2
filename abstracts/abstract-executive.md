\# Elyon-Sol — Executive Abstract



\## Problem

Organizations adopting AI face escalating risk from opaque automation, unclear accountability, and regulatory exposure—especially in healthcare, government, and enterprise settings.



\## Approach

Elyon-Sol provides a governance layer that:

\- Prevents unauthorized automated decisions

\- Enforces human review when required

\- Preserves decision provenance

\- Reduces institutional risk without blocking innovation



It is designed to integrate alongside existing systems, not replace them.



\## Value

\- Reduced regulatory and liability exposure

\- Improved trust and audit readiness

\- Clear operational boundaries for AI use

\- Deployable without re-architecting core systems



\## What to evaluate

\- Fit within existing workflows

\- Risk reduction impact

\- Governance clarity



\## Out of scope

\- AI model performance comparisons

\- Cost optimization unrelated to governance
