Status: Draft  
Scope: Human-in-the-loop enforcement

## Escalation Triggers

Escalation occurs when:
- No clinician-of-record is available
- Authority is ambiguous
- Clinical risk is elevated
- Inputs exceed defined scope

---

## Escalation Behavior

When triggered:
- Automated acceptance is blocked
- Output is labeled advisory
- Human review is required
- The event is logged

---

## Why This Matters

Escalation prevents:
- Silent automation errors
- Overconfidence amplification
- Liability diffusion

It ensures accountability remains human and explicit.
