## Guiding Principles

The Hospital POC aligns with HIPAA through **design constraints**, not policy promises.

---

## Key Practices

- Early classification of PHI
- Segregation of sensitive data
- Minimum-necessary processing
- No model training on PHI
- Deterministic deletion or discard rules
- Explicit access logging

---

## Data Handling Posture

- AI assistance operates on the least sensitive representation possible
- Sensitive fields are excluded where not required
- Outputs are advisory summaries only

---

## Audit Support

All access and handling events are traceable and reviewable,
supporting internal audits and compliance inquiries.

This POC does not claim certification or compliance —
it demonstrates **alignment-ready architecture**.
