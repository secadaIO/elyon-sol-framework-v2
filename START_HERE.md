\# Elyon-Sol Framework — Start Here



\## What this is

Elyon-Sol is a governance-first framework for human–AI collaboration that treats consent, authority, and accountability as first-class system primitives. It is designed to prevent overconfident automation, enforce human escalation when authority is absent, and preserve auditability across technical and institutional contexts.



\## What problem it solves

\- AI systems routinely produce high-confidence outputs in domains where they lack authority.

\- Consent and accountability are often implicit, untracked, or retrofitted after deployment.

\- Existing “AI ethics” approaches lack enforceable invariants or operational guarantees.



\## What this is not

\- Not an autonomous decision-making system

\- Not a diagnostic or clinical tool

\- Not a generalized AGI or chatbot framework

\- Not a replacement for human judgment or institutional authority

\## Frozen vs extensible

\*\*Frozen (core invariants):\*\*

\- Authority separation (confidence ≠ authority)

\- Mandatory human escalation on authority gaps

\- Explicit consent as a prerequisite for action

\- Deterministic, auditable state transitions



\*\*Extensible (non-core):\*\*

\- Domain-specific implementations

\- UI / API layers

\- Institutional policy mappings



\## How to review this work

Useful critique focuses on:

\- Whether authority gaps are correctly detected

\- Whether escalation guarantees are sufficient

\- Whether invariants hold under adversarial or edge conditions



Out-of-scope critique:

\- Feature requests unrelated to governance

\- Speculative AGI discussions

\- Optimization absent safety analysis
