Despite advances in model capability, prevailing approaches to AI governance rely heavily on post-hoc policy enforcement, probabilistic alignment, or narrative assurances rather than deterministic, inspectable constraints. This gap is especially acute in regulated environments such as healthcare, public policy, and institutional decision-making, where confidence does not imply authority and correctness does not imply legitimacy.</p>    <p>The Elyon-Sol Framework proposes a governance-first architectural paradigm in which legitimacy, authority, and safety are enforced as first-class system invariants, rather than emergent properties of model behavior. Elyon-Sol is not a model, nor a classifier layered atop models; it is a meta-governance system that constrains how information is accessed, processed, and asserted across heterogeneous AI components.</p>    <p>At its core, Elyon-Sol introduces a formal separation between epistemic confidence and domain authority, encoded through deterministic control structures, explicit consent gates, and auditable decision routing. The framework is explicitly non-autonomous: it mandates human-in-the-loop escalation whenever authority coverage is incomplete or contested, and it treats the absence of authority as a blocking condition rather than a probabilistic uncertainty.</p></section><section id="principles">    <h2>Core Architectural Principles</h2>    <div class="principle">        <h3>1. Authority ≠ Confidence Invariant</h3>        <p>Elyon-Sol enforces the invariant: High Confidence ⇏ Authority to Answer. This principle is operationalized through the Authority Gap Detection Mechanism, which blocks acceptance of outputs when no authorized domain lens exists, regardless of model confidence. Authority absence is treated as a first-class signal, not a recoverable error.</p>    </div>        <div class="principle">        <h3>2. T²⁶ — Triadic Alphabet Authority Model</h3>        <p>The Triadic Alphabet (T²⁶) defines a bounded authority registry indexed by surname-initial letter L ∈ {A,…,Z}. Each letter yields a triad: L³ = {a₁, a₂, a₃} where each aᵢ represents an independent human authority capable of validating claims within that domain.</p>        <p>Authority is strictly bounded by this structure to prevent overreach and ensure that all claims are validated by multiple independent sources. This model ensures redundancy and diversity in authority, mitigating risks of single-point failure or bias. The triadic structure promotes balanced decision-making and prevents monopolization of authority in any given domain letter.</p>    </div>        <div class="principle">        <h3>3. AC³ — Authority Construct (Triadic Root)</h3>        <p>The Authority Construct (AC³) defines the minimal identity and stewardship quorum required for Elyon-Sol’s governance legitimacy. AC³ is non-expandable without explicit governance votes and anchors identity continuity across versions, forks, and disaster-recovery states.</p>        <p>Formally: AC³ = {H, G, W} where: H = Human Steward, G = Governance Engine, W = External Witness. No governance act is valid without all three roles satisfied.</p>    </div>        <div class="principle">        <h3>4. Consent FSM (Finite State Machine)</h3>        <p>Elyon-Sol enforces explicit consent through a deterministic finite state machine: FSM = (S, Σ, δ, s₀, F). Where: S = consent states (e.g., REQUESTED, GRANTED, REVOKED), δ forbids transitions that would permit processing without explicit grant. Missing consent yields hard fail, not degradation.</p>        <p>This design eliminates silent escalation and prevents unauthorized inference or data handling.</p>    </div>        <div class="principle">        <h3>5. OSPF-SAFE — Open Safest Path First</h3>        <p>Distinct from networking OSPF, OSPF-SAFE is a safety-routing heuristic that selects the least harmful interpretive path under uncertainty: Route = arg min_{p ∈ P} Risk(p). Where P is the set of permissible interpretive actions. If all paths exceed acceptable risk thresholds, the system escalates or blocks.</p>    </div>        <div class="principle">        <h3>6. DRIP / DROP — Data Minimization Pipeline</h3>        <p>Sensitive data handling follows a strict pipeline: 1. Classify, 2. Split, 3. Discard sensitive components, 4. Respond only with permitted residue, 5. Log audit trace.</p>        <p>Formally: Output = f(Input \ Sensitive(Input)). No sensitive data is echoed, stored, or propagated beyond necessity.</p>    </div>        <div class="principle">        <h3>7. HYDE — Human-Yielding Decision Engine</h3>        <p>HYDE ensures that automation yields to humans under defined conditions: If ¬AUTH ∨ ¬CONSENT ⇒ ESCALATE. HYDE explicitly disables autonomous resolution in authority gaps, preventing hallucinated certainty.</p>    </div>        <div class="principle">        <h3>8. CLAIM — Competitive Legitimacy through Architectural Invariants & Measurement</h3>        <p>CLAIM is a core doctrine of Elyon-Sol governance, asserting that legitimacy arises only from: Enforced architectural invariants, Falsifiable, measurable outcomes. Narrative assurances, policy text, or intent do not confer legitimacy. CLAIM binds Elyon-Sol itself and constrains comparative evaluation, competition protocols, and public assertions.</p>    </div>        <div class="principle">        <h3>9. Process Integrity Votes (PIV)</h3>        <p>Elyon-Sol recognizes itself as a governed process. Any self-referential or authority-altering change requires a Process Integrity Vote (PIV) with explicit quorum and external concurrence. PIV outcomes are immutable governance artifacts; absence of a required PIV invalidates the change.</p>    </div>        <div class="principle">        <h3>10. Cryptographic Auditability & Anchoring</h3>        <p>All governance artifacts, test manifests, and critical state transitions may be cryptographically hashed and anchored via public ledgers to provide proof-of-existence, tamper evidence, and audit traceability.</p>    </div></section><section id="posture">    <h2>System Posture and Scope</h2>    <p>Elyon-Sol is: Non-diagnostic, Non-autonomous, Governance-first, Model-agnostic, Fail-closed by default. It is explicitly designed for regulated and high-consequence domains, including healthcare, public institutions, and safety-critical decision support.</p></section><section id="conclusion">    <h2>Conclusion</h2>    <p>The Elyon-Sol Framework reframes AI governance as an engineering discipline, not a policy afterthought. By encoding authority, consent, safety, and legitimacy as deterministic system properties, Elyon-Sol provides a defensible, auditable, and testable foundation for trustworthy AI deployment. Its central thesis is simple but uncompromising: If legitimacy cannot be measured, it cannot be claimed.</p></section><section id="diagrams">    <h2>Supporting Diagrams</h2>    <p>These publicly available diagrams illustrate concepts closely aligned with the Elyon-Sol Framework's emphasis on auditing, architecture, data handling, security processes, and governance principles.</p>    <img src="https://alignment.anthropic.com/2025/petri/figures/petri-alignment-agent-TWITTER-fig-02.jpg" alt="Petri pipeline diagram illustrating the auditing loop with auditor agent, target model, and judge model scoring (similar to original).">        <img src="https://acropolium.com/img/articles/multi-tenant-vs-single-tenant/img01.jpg" alt="Diagram comparing single-tenant vs multi-tenant SaaS applications (similar to original).">        <img src="https://www.slideteam.net/media/catalog/product/cache/1280x720/r/e/restricted_confidential_internal_and_public_data_types_Slide01.jpg" alt="Flowchart for classifying data as public, internal, confidential, or restricted based on disclosure.">    </section><section id="downloads">    <h2>Downloads</h2>    <p>Download the one-pagers for more details:</p>    <ul>        <li><a href="Academic_One_Pager_Elyon-Sol.pdf" download>Academic One-Pager</a></li>        <li><a href="Regulatory_One_Pager_Elyon-Sol.pdf" download>Regulatory One-Pager</a></li>    </ul></section><footer>    &copy; 2025 Elyon-Sol Framework.
