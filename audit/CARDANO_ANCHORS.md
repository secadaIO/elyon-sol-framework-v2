# Cardano Anchors

Status: Draft  
Scope: Optional immutability anchoring  
Governance: Elyon-Sol Framework v1.0.0-structure  

---

## Purpose

Cardano anchoring may be used to provide
tamper-evident, third-party-verifiable references
to governance states or documentation snapshots.

Anchoring is **optional** and **non-operative**.

---

## What Is Anchored

- Hashes of documents or manifests
- Version identifiers
- Governance milestones

---

## What Is Not Anchored

- Personal data
- PHI
- Secrets or credentials
- Executable logic

---

## Interpretation

Anchors serve as **evidence of existence and integrity**,
not authority or control mechanisms.
