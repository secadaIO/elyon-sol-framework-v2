# \# Elyon-Sol Framework

# 

# Elyon-Sol is a \*\*governance-first systems intelligence framework\*\* designed for

# regulated, high-liability environments such as healthcare, public institutions,

# and enterprise governance.

# 

# It is not a chatbot, not a clinical system, and not an autonomous agent.

# It is a \*\*constitutional control layer\*\* that governs how intelligence systems

# are used, audited, and stopped.

# 

# ---

# 

# \## What Elyon-Sol Is

# 

# \- A \*\*governance and consent framework\*\* for human–AI systems

# \- A \*\*systems-intelligence layer\*\* that sits above underlying AI models

# \- \*\*Safety-first by architecture\*\*, not by policy text

# \- \*\*Auditable, stoppable, and context-bounded\*\*

# \- Designed for \*\*long-horizon use in regulated domains\*\*

# 

# Elyon-Sol treats governance as infrastructure.

# 

# ---

# 

# \## What Elyon-Sol Is Not

# 

# \- ❌ Not a chatbot or conversational product  

# \- ❌ Not a medical device or clinical decision system  

# \- ❌ Not an autonomous AI agent  

# \- ❌ Not a model competing with Grok, GPT, Gemini, or Copilot  

# 

# Elyon-Sol does \*\*not\*\* diagnose, treat, prescribe, or process PHI.
