Status: Draft  
Scope: Boundary model (descriptive)  
Governance: Elyon-Sol Framework v1.0.0-structure

## Boundary Types

- **Data Boundary**
  - Sensitive vs non-sensitive separation

- **Authority Boundary**
  - Human authority required for meaningful outcomes

- **Consent Boundary**
  - Processing restricted when consent is invalid

- **Execution Boundary**
  - No autonomous actions

---

## Threats Addressed (Conceptual)

- Accidental disclosure
- Overconfident automation
- Silent escalation suppression
- Context bleed across modes

---

## Default Posture

Fail safe:
- restrict output
- escalate to humans
- log the event
