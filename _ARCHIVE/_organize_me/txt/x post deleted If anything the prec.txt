x post deleted If anything the precedent of the US's inability to govern 110 million less people with oversight of 50 ish individual municipalities should heighten the awareness of the EU's strategy. Considering the sentiment of the EU towards the US this is solidarity in my mind if I were to be an EU citizen. Revamp and watch as the new precedent heightens the awareness of our president. Our president, regardless of sentiment is not stupid. Big business requires big decisions. EUSA 2028, conjugated this for your own meaning. - sub 1M no-one.
