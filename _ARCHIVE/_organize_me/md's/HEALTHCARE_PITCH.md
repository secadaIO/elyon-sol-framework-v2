# Healthcare Executive Pitch — Elyon-Sol

## 1. Problem

Current healthcare AI tools are:
- Either tightly bound to proprietary EHR vendors,
- Or opaque decision-support engines with limited transparency,
- Often optimized for billing and documentation, not human dignity and continuity of care.

## 2. Elyon-Sol's Offer

Elyon-Sol provides:

- **Sovereign Governance Layer**
  - You keep control of your data, workflows, and rules.
  - AI behavior is anchored to a transparent constitutional framework.

- **Emotional and Temporal Continuity**
  - The system remembers context across time in a governed way.
  - This is particularly important for behavioral health, chronic care, and complex cases.

- **Compatibility with Existing Tools**
  - Elyon-Sol can sit above or beside tools like Med-PaLM, Dragon Copilot, Athenahealth AI, and OpenEvidence as a **governance and oversight layer**, not a replacement.

## 3. Why It Matters

- Regulators and patients are increasingly uncomfortable with black-box AI.
- Lawsuits and conflicts (e.g., AI vendors suing each other over prompts and logic) show fragility.
- A sovereign, transparent, consent-first AI governance layer is a **strategic asset**, not a nice-to-have.

## 4. Call to Action

- Pilot Elyon-Sol as a **governance overlay** around your existing AI stack.
- Use it to define what "acceptable AI behavior" means in your organization.
- Anchor your institutional AI policies and changes to an immutable ledger.
