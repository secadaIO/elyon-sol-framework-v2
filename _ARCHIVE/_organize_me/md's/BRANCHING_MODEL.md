# Branching Model — Elyon-Sol

Recommended branches:

- `main` — public, living documentation.
- `stable` — tagged stable releases (v1.3, v1.4, v1.5, ...).
- `dev-private` — private or local development branch.

Usage suggestion:
- Develop new ideas and experiments in `dev-private`.
- Promote them to `main` once coherent and safe.
- Periodically snapshot `main` into `stable` with tags like `v1.5`.
