# Triadic Alphabet v2.0 (Surname-Indexed)

The Triadic Alphabet maps each letter A–Z to a triad of clinicians whose **last names** begin with that letter.

Example (illustrative only):

- S³ = { John Smith, Richard Simon, Terry Sloan }

Each triad (L³) can be used as a symbolic reference for cross-checking perspectives in clinical reasoning, documentation, or governance design.

> NOTE: The actual roster of clinicians should be curated ethically, with consent and respect for their professional standing. This repo does not list real-world names by default.
