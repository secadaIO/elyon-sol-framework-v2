<h1>Elyon-Sol Framework — Conceptual Specification (Public Overview)</h1>

<p>
  This document provides a high-level conceptual overview of the Elyon-Sol framework’s 
  developmental philosophy. Technical internals, governance rules, and subsystem mechanics 
  have been intentionally removed for security and confidentiality. 
</p>

<h2>1. Purpose</h2>
<p>
  Elyon-Sol is built to explore safer, more interpretable AI ecosystem design. 
  This includes conceptual abstraction layers, modular structures, and simulation principles 
  for responsible AI environments.
</p>

<h2>2. Conceptual Layers</h2>
<ul>
  <li>High-level simulation concepts (non-operational).</li>
  <li>Abstract modularity principles for educational and research use.</li>
  <li>Safe-by-design demonstration of structured AI thinking models.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Non-Operational Guarantees</h2>
<ul>
  <li>No executable code.</li>
  <li>No scanning or diagnostic capability.</li>
  <li>No system access or introspection.</li>
  <li>No internal governance logic exposed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Future Directions (Conceptual)</h2>
<p>
  Future public versions may expand upon safe conceptual frameworks for AI modularity 
  and educational simulation environments. These will continue to omit operational internals.
