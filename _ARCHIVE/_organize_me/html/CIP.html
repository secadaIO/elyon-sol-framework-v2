<h1>Elyon-Sol — Concept Expansion Outline (Public Summary)</h1>

<p>
  This outline describes conceptual directions for future AI frameworks in ethical computing, 
  modularity, and interdisciplinary system design. 
  All technical, governance, emotional modeling, and subsystem details have been removed.
</p>

<h2>1. High-Level Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Explore conceptual AI–human collaboration models.</li>
  <li>Develop safe abstractions for modular AI behavior.</li>
  <li>Investigate research pathways in interpretability and decision integrity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Concept Areas (Non-Technical)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Human–AI interface concepts.</li>
  <li>Healthcare-adjacent AI safety ideas.</li>
  <li>Future modular abstractions for educational simulation.</li>
  <li>Distributed conceptual frameworks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Notes</h2>
<p>
  This file intentionally excludes all internal subsystem details, emotional models, 
  governance rules, identity constructs, and architectural specifics.
