    <!-- 1. Executive Overview -->
    <section id="exec-summary">
      <h2>1. Executive Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Healthcare systems today are operating under continuous pressure: workforce shortages, rising acuity,
        reimbursement constraints, regulatory complexity, and rapid technology shifts. At every level of care,
        leaders are being asked to do more with less while preserving safety, satisfaction, and mission integrity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Elyon-Sol is a <strong>systems-intelligence layer</strong> designed to sit alongside your existing
        EHR, communication tools, and operational systems. It is not “another app” or a generic chatbot.
        It is a structured, governed intelligence environment that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduces cognitive and documentation burden on clinicians and staff.</li>
        <li>Improves coordination across disciplines and care settings.</li>
        <li>Enables safer, auditable use of advanced AI within clear governance boundaries.</li>
        <li>Aligns technology behavior with your organization’s values and risk posture.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="kpi-grid">

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>In plain terms:</strong> Elyon-Sol helps transform information chaos into coherent,
        governed workflows — so your clinicians can spend more time practicing medicine and
        less time fighting systems.

    <!-- 2. The Current Healthcare Reality -->
    <section id="reality">
      <h2>2. The Current Healthcare Reality</h2>
      <p>
        Across hospitals, clinics, and behavioral health organizations, the operational picture is consistent:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clinician burnout</strong> accelerated by administrative overhead and fragmented tooling.</li>
        <li><strong>Duplicated effort</strong> as teams re-enter, re-summarize, or re-interpret the same information.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication gaps</strong> between disciplines, shifts, and sites of care.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk exposure</strong> when information is incomplete, delayed, or misrouted.</li>
        <li><strong>Innovation fatigue</strong> from one-off tools that don’t integrate cleanly or scale.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        At the same time, generative AI has entered the conversation, often in the form of:
        consumer chatbots, office-productivity assistants, or specialized vendors making narrow promises.
        These can be useful, but they introduce new questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Where does the model run, and what data does it see?</li>
        <li>How do we ensure behavior is consistent with our clinical and ethical standards?</li>
        <li>Can we audit what the system “said” or “recommended” six months from now?</li>
        <li>How do we avoid fragmentation and “shadow-AI” use by staff?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Healthcare leaders need more than another point solution. They need a way to:
        adopt AI deliberately, govern it coherently, and align it with their actual
        clinical and operational realities.
      </p>

    <!-- 3. What Is Elyon-Sol? -->
    <section id="what-is-elyon-sol">
      <h2>3. What Is Elyon-Sol?</h2>
      <p>
        Elyon-Sol is a <strong>governed systems-intelligence environment</strong> that
        organizes and mediates how advanced language models interact with your clinical
        and operational workflows.
      </p>

      <h3>3.1 Positioning</h3>
      <p>Elyon-Sol is best understood as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A <strong>coordination and reasoning layer</strong> that sits above your existing systems.</li>
        <li>A <strong>governance framework</strong> that constrains behavior and ensures safety-first operation.</li>
        <li>A <strong>co-authoring environment</strong> for documentation, communication, and insight generation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.2 Not Just Another Chatbot</h3>
      <p>
        The market is saturated with “AI assistants” that provide free-form chat. Elyon-Sol is designed differently:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It is <strong>scenario-aware</strong> (e.g., inpatient handoff vs. outpatient intake vs. behavioral health note).</li>
        <li>It is <strong>mode-aware</strong>, separating public, private, and temporal (longitudinal) contexts.</li>
        <li>It is <strong>governance-first</strong>, with explicit rules about what it may and may not do.</li>
        <li>It is <strong>co-authored</strong>: systems are configured with you, not simply sold to you.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.3 Designed with Healthcare Constraints in Mind</h3>
      <p>
        Elyon-Sol was architected from the perspective of a systems strategist who has spent decades working
        in complex environments, not a consumer startup. It assumes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Multiple EHRs and legacy systems may coexist.</li>
        <li>Connectivity may be inconsistent across sites.</li>
        <li>Regulatory and contractual constraints will vary by region and line of service.</li>
        <li>Change management is just as critical as technology selection.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Core Design Principles -->
    <section id="principles">
      <h2>4. Core Design Principles</h2>
      <p>
        Elyon-Sol is built around a small number of non-negotiable principles that guide its behavior in all contexts.
      </p>

      <h3>4.1 Safety First</h3>
      <p>
        Safety is not a feature; it is a routing rule. Elyon-Sol implements an internal heuristic called
        <strong>OSPF – Open Safest Path First</strong>. When uncertainty arises, the system routes toward:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>More conservative interpretations of ambiguous input.</li>
        <li>Escalation to human review where appropriate.</li>
        <li>Refusal to act when the risk surface is unclear.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4.2 Triadic Context Model</h3>
      <p>
        Information is handled through a triadic lens:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Public</strong> – what can be shared with teams and systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Private</strong> – constrained, role-specific or user-specific workspaces.</li>
        <li><strong>Temporal</strong> – longitudinal records of decisions, configurations, and narratives over time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This triadic structure supports both clinical continuity (e.g., longitudinal care narratives)
        and governance continuity (e.g., how the system has evolved and why).
      </p>

      <h3>4.3 Co-Authoring, Not Replacement</h3>
      <p>
        Elyon-Sol is explicitly designed as a <strong>co-author</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Drafting clinical notes that clinicians edit and sign.</li>
        <li>Summarizing complex charts for handoffs, not making triage decisions.</li>
        <li>Proposing task lists, not reassigning staff or beds autonomously.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Agency remains with licensed professionals and authorized decision-makers.
      </p>

      <h3>4.4 Governance Before Scale</h3>
      <p>
        Rather than “deploy everywhere and then add controls,” Elyon-Sol starts with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear boundaries on which data is accessible and why.</li>
        <li>Role-based capabilities and prompts.</li>
        <li>Auditability of key interactions (configurable by policy).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Architecture at a Glance -->
    <section id="architecture">
      <h2>5. Architecture at a Glance</h2>
      <p>
        At a high level, Elyon-Sol is an orchestration layer that connects your data, your rules,
        and advanced language models into governed workflows.
      </p>

      <h3>5.1 Conceptual Diagram</h3>
      <pre>
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|                        Elyon-Sol Layer                      |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|
|  Governance Engine   |  Workflow Orchestrator  |  Audit Log |
+----------------------+-------------------------+------------+
|          Context Manager (Public / Private / Temporal)      |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|    Connectors to EHR, PM, Messaging, Data Warehouse, etc.   |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|         Underlying Language Models & Analytics Engines      |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
      </pre>

      <h3>5.2 Key Components</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Governance Engine</strong> – encodes organizational policies, access rules, and safety constraints.</li>
        <li><strong>Workflow Orchestrator</strong> – structures how prompts, data, and responses move through a task.</li>
        <li><strong>Context Manager</strong> – separates and manages public, private, and temporal information.</li>
        <li><strong>Audit &amp; Observability</strong> – enables longitudinal review of system configurations and key flows.</li>
        <li><strong>Connectors</strong> – integrate with EHRs, messaging platforms, and document stores via standard APIs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5.3 Deployment Models</h3>
      <p>
        Elyon-Sol is designed to be deployment-agnostic:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>On-premise or VPC-hosted</strong> for highly regulated or risk-averse environments.</li>
        <li><strong>Hybrid</strong> – sensitive data stays within your control; models may be accessed via secure endpoints.</li>
        <li><strong>Future on-chain anchors</strong> – selectively anchoring governance events or configurations
            to a distributed ledger for tamper-evident audit (Cardano-aligned, vendor-neutral vision).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. Governance, Data, and Trust -->
    <section id="governance">
      <h2>6. Governance, Data, and Trust</h2>
      <p>
        Trust is not created by marketing; it is created by verifiable structure.
        Elyon-Sol treats governance as a first-class subsystem.
      </p>

      <h3>6.1 Policy as Configuration</h3>
      <p>
        Organizational choices are expressed in explicit configuration rather than informal guidance, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Which roles can initiate which classes of AI-assisted workflows.</li>
        <li>What data sources may be used, and under what conditions.</li>
        <li>What content should be blocked, masked, or flagged for review.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6.2 Longitudinal Governance (Temporal Context)</h3>
      <p>
        The temporal context allows you to see <em>how</em> the system’s behavior has evolved:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Which policies were active at a given time.</li>
        <li>What major changes were made and by whom (e.g., prompts, guardrails, workflow definitions).</li>
        <li>How those changes align with incidents, audits, or new regulatory requirements.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6.3 Data Sovereignty</h3>
      <p>
        Healthcare organizations increasingly demand control over where data resides
        and who can access it. Elyon-Sol’s design supports:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear boundaries between PHI and non-PHI workflows.</li>
        <li>Configurable data retention and deletion policies.</li>
        <li>Future compatibility with ledger-based anchoring for key governance artifacts.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 7. Clinical & Operational Use Cases -->
    <section id="use-cases">
      <h2>7. Clinical &amp; Operational Use Cases</h2>
      <p>
        Elyon-Sol is not limited to one department or discipline. It is designed
        to operate across hospitals, behavioral health, and outpatient groups.
      </p>

      <h3>7.1 Hospital &amp; Health Systems</h3>
      <h4>7.1.1 Inpatient Handoffs</h4>
      <p>
        Use Elyon-Sol to generate structured handoff summaries that integrate key data points
        from the chart and clinician annotations, highlighting:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Active problems and recent changes.</li>
        <li>Outstanding tasks and time-sensitive follow-ups.</li>
        <li>Risk factors (falls, delirium, suicide risk flags, etc., as configured).</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>7.1.2 Consult Coordination</h4>
      <p>
        For multi-specialty cases, Elyon-Sol can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Summarize relevant history tailored to each consulting service.</li>
        <li>Track consult requests and responses in structured, queryable form.</li>
        <li>Provide a unified narrative for the primary team.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>7.1.3 Quality &amp; Operations</h4>
      <p>
        On the operations side, Elyon-Sol can assist quality and operations teams by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Summarizing patterns across incident reports and safety event narratives.</li>
        <li>Supporting preparation for accreditation or site visits with curated document sets.</li>
        <li>Drafting policy updates or training materials for review.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7.2 Behavioral Health, Psychiatry &amp; Social Work</h3>
      <p>
        Behavioral health work is narrative-heavy, risk-sensitive, and deeply human.
        Elyon-Sol is configured to support, not flatten, that nuance.
      </p>

      <h4>7.2.1 Note Drafting &amp; Narrative Coherence</h4>
      <p>
        For therapists, psychiatrists, and social workers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Draft structured notes from session bullet points and clinical impressions.</li>
        <li>Maintain longitudinal narratives that respect the client’s story across time.</li>
        <li>Support cross-discipline communication (e.g., with primary care) via tailored summaries.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>7.2.2 Risk Monitoring &amp; Escalation Support</h4>
      <p>
        Within configured boundaries, Elyon-Sol can help identify patterns in documentation
        that may warrant closer human review (e.g., escalating ideation, adherence challenges).
        Final judgment always rests with clinicians; the system surfaces signals, not decisions.
      </p>

      <h3>7.3 Outpatient &amp; Ambulatory Practices</h3>
      <p>
        For smaller practices and ambulatory groups, the focus is often on time, cash flow,
        and staff capacity.
      </p>

      <h4>7.3.1 Intake &amp; Pre-Visit Summaries</h4>
      <p>
        Elyon-Sol can:

    <!-- 8. Value, Outcomes & ROI Modeling -->
    <section id="roi">
      <h2>8. Value, Outcomes &amp; ROI Modeling</h2>
      <p>
        Every organization will realize value differently, but the levers tend to be consistent:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Time saved per clinician per day.</li>
        <li>Reduction in rework and clarification cycles.</li>
        <li>Improved throughput in key workflows (e.g., notes closed same day).</li>
        <li>Better alignment of documentation with coding and quality metrics.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>8.1 Example Modeled Scenario – Mid-Sized Hospital</h3>
      <p>
        Consider a 300-bed hospital with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>200 clinicians regularly documenting in the EHR.</li>
        <li>Average of 10–12 minutes of documentation per patient interaction.</li>
        <li>High rates of delayed note completion and after-hours work.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If Elyon-Sol reduces documentation time by <strong>30%</strong> for 150 of those clinicians,
        with each clinician documenting on 15 patients per day:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Time saved per clinician per day ≈ 54 minutes.</li>
        <li>Aggregate time saved per day ≈ 135 hours.</li>
        <li>Over 250 working days, ≈ 33,750 hours reallocated to higher-value work.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Even before considering downstream benefits (throughput, satisfaction, reduced turnover),
        the time reallocation alone can justify structured investment.
      </p>

      <h3>8.2 Qualitative Outcomes</h3>
      <p>
        Beyond measurable hours, organizations can expect:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>More consistent handoffs and fewer “information surprises.”</li>
        <li>Improved clinician perception of support and tools.</li>
        <li>Better alignment between daily workflows and strategic modernization goals.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- 9. Implementation Roadmap -->
    <section id="implementation">
      <h2>9. Implementation Roadmap</h2>
      <p>
        Elyon-Sol implementation is intentionally phased. The goal is to start small,
        learn quickly, and expand safely.
      </p>

      <h3>9.1 Phase 1 – Discovery &amp; Design (4–8 Weeks)</h3>

    <!-- 10. Landscape Comparison -->
    <section id="landscape">
      <h2>10. Landscape Comparison</h2>
      <p>
        Many organizations ask: “Why not just use existing AI tools?” It is a reasonable question.
      </p>

      <h3>10.1 Generic Chatbots &amp; Office Assistants</h3>
      <p>
        General-purpose AI tools are powerful but:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>They are not designed specifically for healthcare workflows or governance.</li>
        <li>They often lack explicit, configurable safety and policy layers.</li>
        <li>They are not built as a long-lived systems-intelligence environment.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>10.2 Point-Solution Healthcare Vendors</h3>
      <p>
        Many vendors offer narrow solutions: AI scribes, coding assistants, specialty-specific apps.
        These can be helpful but may:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fragment your AI footprint across multiple products.</li>
        <li>Introduce overlapping or conflicting governance patterns.</li>
        <li>Limit your ability to reason across disciplines and sites of care.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>10.3 Elyon-Sol’s Differentiator</h3>
      <p>
        Elyon-Sol’s core differentiator is that it is a <strong>unifying systems-intelligence and
        governance environment</strong>, not a one-off tool:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Built on a triadic context model and explicit governance principles.</li>
        <li>Designed to integrate into existing infrastructures, not replace them wholesale.</li>
        <li>Co-authored and co-configured with your leadership and frontline teams.</li>
        <li>Future-aligned with decentralized audit and sovereignty concepts without requiring you to adopt them on day one.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 11. Risk, Safety & Compliance -->
    <section id="risk">
      <h2>11. Risk, Safety &amp; Compliance</h2>
      <p>
        Responsible AI in healthcare must treat risk as a first-order design concern.
        Elyon-Sol’s safety posture is grounded in both technical and governance mechanisms.
      </p>

      <h3>11.1 Safety Mechanisms</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>OSPF – Open Safest Path First</strong> routing for ambiguous or high-risk requests.</li>
        <li><strong>Role-aware behavior</strong> – different capabilities for clinicians, operations, and admin users.</li>
        <li><strong>Configurable refusal boundaries</strong> – classes of questions or actions the system will not support.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>11.2 Compliance Alignment</h3>
      <p>
        Elyon-Sol is not a replacement for your compliance program. Rather, it is structured so that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Data flows can be mapped and documented for risk assessments.</li>
        <li>Policies can be expressed in machine-readable configurations.</li>
        <li>Key interactions can be logged for internal audits, as defined by policy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>11.3 Human-in-the-Loop by Default</h3>
      <p>
        Elyon-Sol is designed with human-in-the-loop operation as the norm:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Drafts, summaries, and insights are provided for review and acceptance.</li>
        <li>Clinical and operational decisions remain under human authority.</li>
        <li>Automation is applied primarily to reduce friction, not to replace judgment.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 12. Strategic Roadmap & Extensions -->
    <section id="roadmap">
      <h2>12. Strategic Roadmap &amp; Extensions</h2>
      <p>
        Elyon-Sol is conceived as an evolving system, not a static product.
        The roadmap includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Deeper specialty modules</strong> – e.g., oncology, perioperative workflows, complex case management.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced behavioral health capabilities</strong> to support interdisciplinary treatment teams.</li>
        <li><strong>Structured integration with on-chain anchors</strong> for governance artifacts (e.g., signed policies,
            versioned safety configurations) to support high-assurance environments.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics overlays</strong> that help leaders see patterns in how the system is used,
            where value is generated, and where risk clusters may emerge.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The central design commitment is that new capabilities are evaluated against the core principles:
        safety first, triadic context integrity, and co-authored governance.
