This document is descriptive only.
It contains no executable logic, no autonomous decision-making,
and no diagnostic or clinical assertions.

## Authority
Permission to allow execution. Authority cannot be inferred, assumed, or substituted.
Execution requires VERIFIED authority.

## Authority Gap (T²⁶)
A valid, blocking state indicating absence of authority.
Absence is not an error; it is a correct outcome.

## Consent
A stateful, revocable, time-bound signal required for interpretation and execution consideration.
Consent is never sufficient for execution.

## Identity
A governed signal that may inform context and scope matching.
Identity never grants consent or authority.

## Confidence
A measure of model certainty.
Confidence is advisory only and never substitutes for authority.

## FAIL
A correct, stable outcome where action is refused safely and explainably.
