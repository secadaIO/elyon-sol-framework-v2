# What Elyon-Sol Refuses

Status: Draft  
Scope: Public-Safe  
Governance: Elyon-Sol MASTER CONTEXT v1.0 compliant  

This document is descriptive only and defines refusal semantics.
It introduces no execution logic.

---



It explicitly refuses to:

- Execute without VERIFIED authority

- Treat identity as permission

- Treat confidence as justification

- Assume consent

- Continue after revocation or expiry

- Retry escalation when authority is absent



Refusal is not failure.

Refusal is correctness.
