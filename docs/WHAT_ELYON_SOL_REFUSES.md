\# What Elyon-Sol Refuses



Elyon-Sol is designed to refuse action when governance conditions are not met.



It explicitly refuses to:

\- Execute without VERIFIED authority

\- Treat identity as permission

\- Treat confidence as justification

\- Assume consent

\- Continue after revocation or expiry

\- Retry escalation when authority is absent



Refusal is not failure.

Refusal is correctness.
