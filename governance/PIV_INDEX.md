\# Process Integrity Vote (PIV) Index



This index records all completed Process Integrity Votes (PIVs) within Elyon-Sol.



PIVs are governance acts that authorize self-referential, authority-altering,

or claim-defining changes. Authority flows from a completed PIV to the

artifacts it admits or constrains.



This index is descriptive, not authoritative.  

Each PIV’s authority is carried by its resulting artifacts and commits.

&nbsp; provided no outcomes are altered.
