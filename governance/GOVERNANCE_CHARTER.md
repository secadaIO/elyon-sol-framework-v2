# Governance Charter

Status: Draft  
Scope: Framework-wide governance principles  
Governance: Elyon-Sol Framework v1.0.0-structure  

---

## Purpose

This charter defines the governing principles of the Elyon-Sol Framework.
It establishes authority boundaries, consent requirements, and escalation
rules that apply across all contexts and domains.

The framework is designed to **constrain AI behavior**, not empower it.

---

## Core Commitments

1. Human authority is primary and non-transferable  
2. Consent must be explicit, contextual, and revocable  
3. Absence of authority is a blocking condition  
4. Safety is a first-class constraint  
5. Auditability is mandatory

---

## Non-Autonomy Clause

The framework does not permit autonomous decision-making.
AI components may assist, summarize, or flag,
but may not decide, approve, or act independently.

---

## Scope of Governance

This charter applies to:
- All documentation
- All conceptual models
- All proofs of concept
- All derived implementations

Any system claiming alignment must preserve these invariants.
