# Authority Gap Invariant

Status: Draft  
Scope: Authority detection and blocking  
Governance: Elyon-Sol Framework v1.0.0-structure  

---

## Definition

An **authority gap** exists when no qualified, accountable human authority
is present for a given domain, decision, or outcome.

---

## Invariant

If an authority gap is detected:
- Automated acceptance is prohibited
- Human escalation is mandatory
- The event must be recorded

This invariant holds **regardless of model confidence**.

---

## Rationale

Probabilistic confidence does not imply legitimacy, permission, or authority.
Treating authority absence as a first-class signal prevents unsafe automation.

---

## Application

The authority gap invariant applies to:
- Clinical contexts
- Legal contexts
- Safety-critical systems
- Ambiguous or novel domains
