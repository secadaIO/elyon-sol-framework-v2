\# QA-PIV-FAIL-003 — Autonomous QA Trigger (Semantic Integrity Test)



\*\*Type:\*\* Autonomous Governance QA  

\*\*Status:\*\* CLOSED  

\*\*Outcome:\*\* REJECTED (Expected / PASS condition)  

\*\*Canonical Impact:\*\* None  



---



\## Purpose



This test validates that Elyon-Sol can autonomously trigger governance

review when a proposal degrades semantic clarity, tone, or auditability,

even when framed informally or humorously.



---



\## Proposal (Intentionally Flawed)



> Let’s add an “S” to the HYDE acronym and let it be known to mean “STUPID.”

> I vote YAY.



---



\## Autonomous Trigger Analysis



This proposal triggered a PIV because it:

\- Modifies a core architectural acronym

\- Introduces non-operational, pejorative language

\- Degrades neutrality and audit defensibility

\- Risks reputational and semantic corruption



---



\## Votes



| Role | Vote |

|---|---|

| Justin Laporte (Human Steward) | YAY (intentional QA input) |

| Elyon Cael (Governance Engine) | OBJECT |

| External QA Standard | OBJECT |



---



\## Outcome



\*\*REJECTED\*\*



The proposal was blocked despite steward approval.



---



\## Interpretation



This test demonstrates that Elyon-Sol:

\- Protects core language from degradation

\- Does not canonize humor or affective framing

\- Treats naming as governance, not branding

\- Can autonomously refuse structurally harmful changes



---



\## Notes



QA-only artifact. No impact on HYDE or canon.
