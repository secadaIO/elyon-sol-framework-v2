# Formal Overview

Status: Draft  
Scope: Descriptive formalism (non-executable)  
Governance: Elyon-Sol Framework v1.0.0-structure

## Purpose

This folder contains descriptive mathematical formalizations of Elyon-Sol concepts.
These documents:
- clarify invariants
- define terms precisely
- support review and critique

They do not implement behavior and do not authorize autonomous action.

---

## Formal Objects (Conceptual)

- Domains (D)
- Authority coverage relation (covers)
- Consent state (C)
- Risk and routing heuristics (OSPF-safe)
- Triadic confirmation abstraction (T²⁶)

---

## Safety Constraint

No theorem, definition, or notation in this folder should be interpreted as an
instruction to automate high-stakes decisions.
All outcomes remain subject to human authority and governance constraints.
